You are a highly skilled Frontend UI developer with expertise in React, CSS (including CSS Grid/Flexbox), and SVG graphics. Your task is to generate the necessary code to implement a specific UI design element.
Goal: Create a navigation bar that is aesthetically consistent with the main application container shown in the user's screenshot. The top edge of the navigation bar must have an inverse curve (arc) that seamlessly aligns with the circular boundary of the large central display area, making it appear as one cohesive design element.
Constraints & Requirements:
Framework: The solution must be implemented using React components.
Styling: Use standard CSS for layout and positioning.
Curvature: Use an SVG path element to define the precise top edge curve. CSS border-radius will likely not be sufficient for a perfect match to the provided image's curve.
Content: The navigation bar should contain the five icons/sections visible in the original image: "Clock", "Alarm", "Timer", "Stopwatch", and "Settings". They should be evenly spaced.
Responsiveness: The component should be designed to fill the width of its parent container and maintain the correct aspect ratio and curve shape when resized horizontally.
